# image_processing_project-
image_processing:
This code takes four images. For the first, it obtains the size of the image, then 
converts it into grayscale and binary. For the second image, Gaussian noise is 
added to it and is filtered using two methods, a gaussian mask and a uniform 
smoothing mask. The image k-means segmentation is performed on it. The 
last canny edge detection is performed and Hough transform to find the 
lines in the image.
